# future work

## fs-polyfill
- inline compiled code at build time instead of runtime fs.readFileSync()
- add dedicated test suite for the package
- implement watch(), watchFile(), unwatchFile() (currently throws "not implemented")
- implement proper stream behavior for createReadStream/createWriteStream (backpressure, events)
- implement fs.compose() (currently throws "not implemented")
- improve binary file handling (currently text-based internally)

## Node.js polyfills
- worker_threads - not available
- crypto.subtle (Web Crypto API) - requires native crypto, not available in isolated-vm
- http.Agent / https.Agent - connection pooling not supported (currently throws "not implemented")
- module.SourceMap - source map parsing not implemented (currently throws "not implemented")
- child_process streams - stdin/stdout/stderr are simplified stubs (buffer everything, emit on completion)
- read Node.js API docs (https://nodejs.org/api/all.json) and write a script to verify import/exports match official Node.js modules (could use TypeScript types)

## Intentionally not implemented (sandbox security)
- child_process.fork - IPC between processes not supported
- http.createServer / https.createServer - no server mode in sandbox
- process.dlopen - dynamic loading not supported
- .node native extensions - native modules not supported

## WASM/bash
- batch commands hang - `bash -c "echo hello"` never returns from instance.wait() in WASI/WASIX bash. interactive mode works fine
- WASM memory limits - memoryLimit is plumbed through but not yet enforced on WASM side

## other
- get claude code cli working in this emulator
- emulate npm
- native addon polyfills - npm packages with native C/C++ bindings won't work in isolated-vm. may need a polyfill registry mapping them to pure-JS alternatives (e.g. esbuild→esbuild-wasm, bcrypt→bcryptjs, sharp→sharp-wasm, sqlite3→sql.js)
- pre-build node-stdlib-browser polyfills - bundle all polyfills at build time instead of on-demand via esbuild, reduces runtime overhead and startup latency
- dynamically add packages from wasmer registry - allow installing WASM packages at runtime via `Wasmer.fromRegistry()` (e.g. python, ruby, ffmpeg)
