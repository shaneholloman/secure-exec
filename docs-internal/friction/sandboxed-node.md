# Sandboxed Node Friction Log

## 2026-02-27

1. **[resolved]** Runtime CPU budget enforcement was not wired end-to-end.
   - Symptom: option-level timeout helpers existed, but execution paths still risked unbounded loops or post-timeout state reuse.
   - Fix: added/standardized `cpuTimeLimitMs` support, enforced shared execution deadlines across CJS/ESM/dynamic-import/active-handle paths, normalized timeout contract (`code: 124`, `CPU time limit exceeded`), and recycled isolate state after timeout.

2. TODO: runtime timing side-channel hardening is specified but not yet implemented.
   - Symptom: sandboxed code currently observes advancing `Date.now()` / `performance.now()` and has no hardened timing profile.
   - Next step: implement OpenSpec change `mitigate-timing-attacks` with security-first defaults (`timingMitigation` defaults to `"freeze"` + `cpuTimeLimitMs`) and add parity/deviation tests (`"off"` compatibility mode included).

## 2026-02-26

1. **[resolved]** Bridging `@hono/node-server` violated strict sandbox boundary policy.
   - Symptom: third-party module behavior was injected via bridge instead of coming from sandboxed `node_modules`.
   - Fix: removed `@hono/node-server` bridge completely; replaced with built-in Node `http.createServer` bridge (`NetworkAdapter.httpServerListen/httpServerClose`) and kept framework code in sandboxed `node_modules`.

2. **[resolved]** Needed host-driven verification path for sandbox HTTP servers.
   - Symptom: Hono runner self-tested using in-sandbox `fetch`, which did not verify host-to-sandbox request path.
   - Fix: added host-side `NodeProcess.network.fetch(...)` facade and updated `examples/hono/loader` to issue requests and terminate from loader.

3. **[resolved]** Bridge bundle could go stale when non-entry bridge files changed.
   - Symptom: runtime still used old `dist/bridge.js` behavior (for example `http.createServer` still throwing) after editing `src/bridge/network.ts`.
   - Fix: bridge loader now rebuilds when any file under `src/bridge/` is newer than `dist/bridge.js`, not just when `index.ts` changes.

4. **[resolved]** `@hono/node-server` path failed with `400` due `http2` runtime assumptions.
   - Symptom: requests reached the sandbox server but responded `400`; root cause was `instanceof http2.Http2ServerRequest` checks throwing when `http2` constructors were undefined.
   - Fix: added built-in `http2` compatibility stubs (`Http2ServerRequest`/`Http2ServerResponse`) and routed `require('http2')` / ESM `import 'http2'` to that stub module.

5. **[resolved]** Direct cloning of ESM module namespace objects failed in `isolated-vm`.
   - Symptom: using `entryModule.namespace.copy()` for `run()` exports failed with `[object Module] could not be cloned`.
   - Fix: after ESM evaluation, bind the namespace in isolate scope and copy `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(namespace))` to the host.

6. **[resolved]** Project-matrix fixture installs were repeated on every run.
   - Symptom: compatibility fixtures paid repeated `copy + pnpm install` cost even when fixture inputs were unchanged.
   - Fix: added persistent fixture install cache under `packages/sandboxed-node/.cache/project-matrix/` keyed by fixture/toolchain/runtime factors with `.ready` marker semantics. Repeated `test:project-matrix` runs now reuse prepared installs.

7. TODO: follow up on lazy dynamic-import edge cases in ESM execution.
   - Symptom: `filePath: "/entry.mjs"` with top-level `await import("./mod.mjs")` can log pre-import output and imported-module side effects but miss post-await statements.
   - Next step: add a dedicated ESM top-level-await + dynamic-import regression test.

7. **[resolved]** Dynamic import error/fallback path masked ESM failures behind CJS-style wrappers.
   - Symptom: ESM compile/evaluation failures could be rethrown as generic dynamic-import errors, and fallback namespace construction could throw for primitive/null CommonJS exports.
   - Fix: dynamic import now preserves original ESM failure messages, restricts require fallback to explicit `.cjs`/`.json` specifiers, and constructs safe fallback namespaces with `default` for primitive/null exports.

## 2026-02-25

1. **[resolved]** Package resolution for `node_modules` was too limited.
   - Symptom: packages with `exports` maps and `.mjs/.cjs` entrypoints (including modern ESM-first packages) were not reliably resolvable.
   - Fix: expanded `package-bundler` resolution logic to support `exports` condition keys, extension probing for `.mjs/.cjs`, and import-vs-require mode preference.

2. **[resolved]** `http.createServer()` path was blocked in the sandbox runtime.
   - Symptom: server-oriented frameworks could not boot; existing bridge intentionally threw for `http.createServer`.
   - Fix: introduced a bridged `@hono/node-server` runtime module inside the isolate plus host-side `NetworkAdapter.honoServe/honoClose`, backed by real `@hono/node-server` in the Node driver.

3. **[resolved]** Workspace layout originally only matched one-level examples.
   - Symptom: nested `examples/hono/loader` and `examples/hono/runner` packages were not included in the pnpm workspace.
   - Fix: added `examples/*/*` to workspace globs.

4. **[resolved]** `require('fs')` depended on `globalThis.bridge`, but bridge loading did not publish the bridge object globally.
   - Symptom: `fs` resolved to `{}` and `readFileSync` was missing.
   - Fix: updated bridge loader wrappers to assign `globalThis.bridge = bridge` during bridge initialization.

5. **[resolved]** Relative import resolution in package directories preferred directories over sibling files.
   - Symptom: requests like `require('./request')` failed when both `request/` and `request.js` existed.
   - Fix: changed resolver order to match Node behavior: file + extension probes run before directory index/package resolution.

6. ESM + top-level await in this runtime path can return early for long async waits.
   - Symptom: module evaluation could finish before awaited async work (timers/network) completed.
   - Mitigation for example: runner switched to CJS async-IIFE, which `exec()` already awaits reliably.

7. `sandboxed-node` package build currently fails due to broad pre-existing type errors in bridge/browser files.
   - Symptom: importing `sandboxed-node` from `dist/` in example loader was not reliable in this workspace state.
   - Mitigation for example: loader imports `packages/sandboxed-node/src/index.ts` directly so the end-to-end example can run without a successful package build.
   - Note: 32+ type errors remain across child-process, network, os, process, and polyfills bridge files (as of 2026-02-25).

8. **[resolved]** Workspace-linked `node_modules` in the runner package caused environment coupling.
   - Symptom: runner execution could be influenced by workspace layout and local symlinked install topology.
   - Fix: loader now copies runner sources into a fresh temp directory and runs `pnpm install --ignore-workspace` there before sandbox execution.
